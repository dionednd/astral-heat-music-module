Astral Heat Music for OHMSBY Style Characters v0.0.1

-- To Install, simply drag and drop this file to the external/mods/ folder.
-- To define astral heat music for your OHMSBY Style Character,
-- Simply go to your select.def and add this to your characters:
-- ", astral.music = chars/Ragna/Ragna.mp3" (without the quotes)
-- Your character should be looking like this now:
-- Ragna, astral.music = chars/Ragna/Ragna.mp3
-- you can even define the volume, loop, loopstart, loopend, startposition and so on! (i haven't tested some of these parameters yet)
--
-- you can have the music be anywhere ikemen go's directory, and even have multiple characters have the same astral bgm like the RWBY characters.
--
-- Additional Note: the astral heat music doesn't play as soon as you attempt an astral heat. the music plays once you successfully land the astral heat.
-- This module will only work for the recent nightly builds.
